                <p>My primary school when I was 7 years old was in Sarawak.<br> However, after moving to Sabah, I attended SK St. Patrick for my primary education and took the UPSR test. I have a lot of fantastic friends and have a great time playing sports.</p>

                <h2>Secondary school</h2>
                <p>I attend SM ST Patrick Secondary School, which is the same kind of school which I previously attended for my primary education. I took the PT3 exam in high school, then from Form 4 to Form 5 I have enrolled in the sciences stream. This is where I also take my SPM examinations. It was a priceless moment that I still treasure today.</p>

                <h2>Uitm University</h2>
                <p>IWhen I was 18 years old, I went to Uitm Machang in Kelatan. I didn't start attending college until this semester, which is also my final semester for this diploma because of COVID-19. Despite spending two years learning completely online, I have learned a lot. Nonetheless, I started college this past semester, and as a result, I've made a tonne of wonderful friends and had an amazing experience.</p>

                <h2>Uitm University</h2>
                <p>I majored in information management, so some of my courses, including those on libraries, records, and systems, directly prepared me for using information technology. My major required a lot of writing and research for every subject.<br> IMD311's final assignment for my semester required me to create a website. This training provided me with the practical skills I needed to understand how to set up and build a website.</p>
