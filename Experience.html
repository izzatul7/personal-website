                   <h2>Selling Food in the Ramadhan Bazaar</h2>
                   <p>When I was 15 years old, my family and I worked at a food booth at the bazaar ramadhan, selling popia, laksam, and Nasi Dagang.<br>Overall, even if it was somewhat challenging to accomplish it throughout the fasting month. In the end, it was satisfying and joyful.</p>

                    <h2>Knowledge and skills</h2>
                    <p>I learned a lot of new information and abilities while in college. For instance, I am proficient in and have experience utilising Adobe Animate, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. My ability to use and apply this knowledge has improved as a result of all of this learning.</p>

                    <h2>Online class during Covid-19</h2>
                    <p>Since I didn't have to significantly alter my daily schedule and the lecturer was accommodating and understanding during those times, I have enjoyed the switch from offline to online classes. This is because of the web conferencing platform's simplicity and effectiveness, the ability to stay in constant contact with classmates and professors via various channels, and the ability to continue taking classes while maintaining my current schedule.</p>
